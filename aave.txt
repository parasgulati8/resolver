hidetaka says We are thinking of creating something like a Web3 version of Patreon.

We envision the following use cases for your technology lie below.

Are you eligible in either case for your prize?„ÄÄOr is only one of the two eligible? Or do you have any idea?

1. Provide a UX that makes it easy for creators to lend their earnings to lenders using AAVE.

2. Allow fans to donate AAVE yields to creators.

defispartan says <@533994454391062529> can assist with Lens questions
defispartan says You can post here or DM me (may be slow to respond over holiday weekend though)
defispartan says For this hackathon, Aave is offering prizes for 5 different project categories: https://discord.com/channels/554623348622098432/1006682877653688340/1013888945110655036. The first idea sounds like it could fit into the accessibility or stablecoins category. The second idea also sounds like it could fall under accessibility, though I will warn that this project would be more technically challenging

pash161 says Hey Team!
This might be little out of context here. But we are building a analytics platform for DAO contributors. ( with analytics like discord activity, forum activity, snapshot activity). 
This analytics platform also powers the overall governance process.
As per Aave grants DAO notion page i see there is a requirement for a Governance UI and i feel what we are building could solve this.
Who can i talk to from Aave team to understand the exact requirement for this Governance UI.
pash161 says gm gm!!!
joelcodes says Have a great weekend! I sent it over so you can read (~2mins) at your convenience
nftartboy says Hi Aave and Lens team,
our team is considering to use Lens Protocol, but our wallet adresses seem to be not eligible. Is there any chance to get our handles anyways?
0xbilll says Hey Pash! The best way to get feedback on a grant is to submit an application with what you're thinking through the aave grants website. That page isn't meant to be strict bounties but rather inspiration for builders.  Let's keep this chat focused on the hackathon tho!
0xbilll says Feel free to reply to this Tweet with what you're building! https://twitter.com/AaveGrants/status/1567157547185983488
0xsoe says Hey <@751163174769786982>  our team is working on fixed income assets using Aave & efficient AMM optimized for zero-coupon bond .
As you said above, to win Aave's prizes at this hack, do we have to necessarily  apply through the aave grants website?
numtel says This sounds similar to the sticky app I helped build at ethmexico, where content creators are paid out the yield from the investment fund that's in an aave pool https://ethglobal.com/showcase/sticky-app-mzxc5
0xbilll says No, grants are totally seperate from the hackathon bounties

vishuu0123 says <@202112256081788929>  please check dm
numtel says Thanks for the presentation. I was watching on YouTube so I couldn't ask a question but I was wondering if I would still be eligible for the social credit prize if I only use lens as part of the account reputation profile? My goal is to enable partially collateralized loans but if I do the borrowing on aave with onBehalfOf, the borrower will have to pay interest on aave as well as any agreed interest to the lender. Also, wondering if eligible for accessibility prize if this app performs all HTML rendering on chain in order to be censorship resistant.
.sha256yan says hello, thinking of building an amortization schedule for aave loans which automatically makes payments at set intervals, wondering if a similar service exists already
stanislav6300 says Hello! We`ve an idea how to integrate aave to our project. Could we set up a small call with aave's representative?
defispartan says Hey there, yep this would certainly be eligible. And yes the delegator is responsible for paying the accrued interest plus any agreed-upon premium. To handle the calculations for this I would recommend performing the delegation through a vault such as this (https://medium.com/aave/first-credit-delegation-on-aave-protocol-to-deversifi-is-here-c6c0aedb70d4). And yes absolutely a censorship-resistant interface would be eligible for the accessibility category
defispartan says I've heard of protocol doing scheduled interest payouts, but I'm not aware of any project which does this for repayments
defispartan says Feel free to send me a DM and we can set something up
zkmeta says hi, my team is thinking about adding some transaction builder functionality into our project. I was wondering if we could meet with someone from AAVE to get feedback on our initial ideas and help us brainstorm some additional use cases. As well as some initial guidance on writing the routing contract
donoso_eth says hi <@202112256081788929> , thks for the presentation and the passion, justr saw the recording.
donoso_eth says Have though a question. Developing in a hardhat network forked is awesome (like the aave sandbox), however, sometimes would make the process easier when developpin on a testnet, are the aave contracts deployed on testnets and there are some liquidity?, or the sandbox is the only way to develop?
zkgpt says I think they do have deployed the protocol to Testnets, and you could get the testnet addresses from the dev doc https://docs.aave.com/developers/deployed-contracts/v3-testnet-addresses, or you could access the testnet UI via https://staging.aave.com/
donoso_eth says thks @web3, just oversaw this

nanquiedo says Hello!
nanquiedo says Is there a recommended way to obtain a users health factor at a given past time?
nanquiedo says I have obtained the user's deposit/withdraw/borrow/repay/liquidation history from the graph but I don't know how I would go about calculating the health factor at a given time considering the interest rates
with the info I have right now I can only calculate health factors based on the principal amount of loans
Could there be a way to obtain the interest accrued by the user instead of calculating it?
stanislav6300 says Hi <@202112256081788929>! Could you please check the DM.
nanquiedo says Could anyone help me with calculating a history of accrued interest?
nanquiedo says I'm having problems calculating interest for variable interest rate
defispartan says Unfortunately certain assets have been minted to the max_uint256, so they can no longer be minted :/ We are working on a V2 of faucets that fixes this
defispartan says You can call `getUserAccountData` on the Pool contract at a pervious block using ethers (querying a full archive node) or perform this simulation in a browser using https://tenderly.co
joelcodes says Oooof that‚Äôs a bummer. Can you send me some directly?
nanquiedo says Thank you very much for your answer <@202112256081788929>, I'm looking into it right now. I think I'm very close to obtaining the full dataset I need. üòÉ
zhanganiev says Hello there

We are building raffle application for nfts, and we will have some `idle assets` (erc20, erc777) locked in contract.
We are looking for the way to use `idle assets` effectively in favor of application users and protocol treasury.

Is there is straight forward solution for it from AAVE?
Thank you
numtel says Hello, so I just realized that I've been creating a P2P lending app that's very similar to ETHLend but I can't find any kind of post mortem about it, the website just redirects to Aave.com. What happened to ETHLend?
Howard Peng says hiiii
sarvagnakadiya says Hello AAVE,
how can I supply/withdraw funds to your Pool(AAVE)
can you please help me with it
It would be great if you share a little example of it.
numtel says I'm not affiliated with aave but here's an example of how to deposit and withdrawal. https://github.com/numtel/sticky-contracts/blob/main/contracts/StickyInterestSkimmer.sol#L47 There's a mock pool and test too in the other directory
sarvagnakadiya says Thanks for the help <@396436305531240448> 
But just to be sure. Do we have to use deposit() function to deposit onto AAVE pool?
sarvagnakadiya says because as I read the documentation, we need to use supply() function to upload it on Pool.
numtel says I think that might be the old version that uses supply?
numtel says The confusing part to me was the last 2 arguments of the deposit function: onBehalfOf and referralCode
numtel says You can deposit to another account with onBehalfOf
numtel says Afaik, referralCode doesn't matter, so that's why I used 0
sarvagnakadiya says I think supply() is the new version for it.
sarvagnakadiya says https://docs.aave.com/developers/core-contracts/pool
have a look.
numtel says Oh hmm maybe it's just an alias to the same function
sarvagnakadiya says Okay thankyou for your help. I might try using the deposit() function.
numtel says Ok you're right with supply
numtel says If you look at the pool.sol file on GitHub it says deposit is deprecated but maintained for compatibility
sarvagnakadiya says Okay! thankyou for your help
aayush_gupta says we are trying to create treasury dapp for DAO and want to earn yield on capital. can we use` AAVE` to do that and if yes, How ? and are we still qualify for bounty ?
mmsaki says hi team aave, I want to use some WETH on optimism goerli I was wondering what function allows me to  mint the ERC20 mintable on testnet
mmsaki says I was able to figure it out
hashharan says Hey AAVE team and fellow hackers, I have been flirting with this idea for some time and have finally decided to do it for this Hackathon. My goal is to create a ERC20 shorting protocol that simplifies the process of shorting any ERC20 tokens. My idea goes like this. When user comes wanting to short a particular amount of crypto currency. The protocol will collateral from them as required by AAVE to borrow that amount of crypto currency. We place the collateral to AAVE take the crypto currency and sell it in UNISWAP. This will effectively create a short position for the user. If the value of the crypto currency goes down and when the user wants to close the short position I will buy back the crypto from UNISWAP at a cheaper price and pay it back to AAVE and get my initial collateral back. Booking the difference as profit. If the price goes up but liquidation threshold is not reached the user can close the position booking a loss. In case it is liquidated the user books full loss corresponding to the LTV of the crypto currency when the loan was taken.
hashharan says Well what do guys think about this? Am I missing something?
hashharan says Will I be able offset the interest owed to AAVE for the borrowed crypto currency by lending the collateral and taking interest?
paulodiaz says We want to build an uncollateralized lending platform around AAVE's credit delegation features. For this, we have created a credit score model to provide lenders with information about borrowers behavior using AAVE collateralized borrowing history and Lens Protocol interactions with other users.
We are starting with coding and would like to hear some feedback on the project. Also we intend to add a feature where lenders can diversify their loans by depositing into a pools and lend to many users at a time.  Send me DM
koheingt says gmgm <@202112256081788929> 
its been a while since we met at ethdenver (:

we are building an operation tool for delegatees to solve voter apathy issue and make defi protocols like aave to be robust and resilient.
so love to get some feedback from u!
https://kohei-eth.notion.site/ETHOnline-2022-Operation-System-for-Delegatees-f7760e8d4cd04e3c8d3dce2028805c85
numtel says I think aave grants dao just awarded a grant to build such a thing, not to dissuade your efforts https://airtable.com/shrfKMMjmEGsLBAJo/tblTo9YFEL3FyypwZ/viw10yypfQuTU9ut1/rece2ne5aEG47gTmh
numtel says Hello, I'm also building an uncollateralized loan platform. I've got it mostly coded now but didn't write anything for aave credit delegation. (I wanted full capital efficiency even if it disaligns me from the prizes) If you haven't started coding yet and want to simplify your project by writing an aave delegation contract that interacts on top of my lwned as an optional feature for lenders, let me know, there's plenty of space on my team, (just me atm) otherwise maybe I'll have time to write something like that myself, not sure yet https://ethglobal.com/showcase/lwned-75x0f
koheingt says oh thanks for sharing! didnt know jun is working on recognized delegate program now (:
but to ur point its quite different thing. this is more like a framing a role, responsibility and compensation for paid delegatee role at aave (like recognized delegate program at Maker) and our pj is a internal management tool to reduce the friction of delegatees' work.
numtel says Oh interesting, that sounds pretty good
hashharan says 
hashharan says let me know what do you guys think üôÇ
hashharan says dm open
numtel says You should make the whole thing an erc20 token where mint() performs the actions on the left and burn() performs the actions on the right, then it solves the "some tokenized representation" thing
numtel says Not sure if there's any issues with opening positions at different times but then you could have your own set of short tokens to mirror aTokens. I think there are already some leveraged long/short tokens that exist
numtel says Maybe it makes more sense to be an NFT than an erc20 since each position is going to have a unique liquidation price
hashharan says I didn't get into how exactly the tokenized representation should be but both very good ideas
hashharan says Can you point me to these projects or repos that do this?
numtel says I don't know, I've just seen them while browsing coingecko sometimes. I can take a look if you can't find anything
hashharan says sure let me take look first and contact you
hashharan says the short option in coin gecko does not seem to do anything further
l0gykal says Hello I'd be interested to know if we can build something on top of AAVE Portals yet?
donoso_eth says Hi, I was wondering whether it is possible to check when after a credit delegation to a user, if this user has already borrowed the amount. I imagine there is no call back when the user borrows? any help is welcome
donoso_eth says Hi, I am trying on mumbai to min the 'usdc mintable token' tried several times but pending for a lot of time and then fails
donoso_eth says https://mumbai.polygonscan.com/tx/0x8d5995566e305d6d0c463357a4bdce32fd21faa4eeb267d8364689df6a95f6d6
donoso_eth says In other project I've tested on goerli and works perfectly
l0gykal says <@202112256081788929>
0xprat says Hey guys looking to talk to someone from the team regarding our project
donoso_eth says Hi, having this error when using faucet on mumbai on staging.aave.com
donoso_eth says 
donoso_eth says not able to change any parameters
numtel says Take a look at this token https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/3x-long-bitcoin-token
numtel says Looks like it is managed by an oracle service by ftx. If you can do it all on chain, that'd be cool. I'd imagine you'd have to rebase balances if the volatility range goes too far.
stanislav6300 says Hello #aave! We'd like to deploy our DeForex project to Optimism Goerly testnet. 
Do you have your contracts for tests there?
zkgpt says you can get all Testnet contracts address from https://docs.aave.com/developers/deployed-contracts/v3-testnet-addresses
stanislav6300 says Thanks!
markcarey says Looking to interact with Aave V3 on mumbai, but seems all the `ERC20Mintable` test tokens are all taken (minted to the point that the totalSupply cannot be increased further). Any suggestion how we can test? üòâ
0xJess says <@923971611047112705> <@822180265753444412> The mumbai faucet is depleted, you can try a different test market until the faucet is renewed. Here is the link for the testnet addresses https://docs.aave.com/developers/deployed-contracts/v3-testnet-addresses
zhanganiev says Hello,

In our project we have erc20 iddle assets. So we want those assets to work and not iddle.
If aave could solve that problem?

Would be glad to brainstorm about it and get solidity support like pair coding.

1. Do you have office hours?
2. Can we expect solidity support for aave implementation?
donoso_eth says thks, would be renewed before the end of hackathon?
markcarey says Thanks. Yeah, I went with Goerli instead.... üòâ
dolocat says Hi, may I know where can I get the aToken address after I've call supply() to the pool.sol? It seems that the function doesn't return the aToken address.
markcarey says It seems like the aToken address is output in one of the Events emitted. That said, I just look up the aToken addresses manually and store them in variables, so in my code I know that when supplying X, the AToken address will be Y, etc.
_heeze says wanted to know what the base currency of the aave price feed is
0xJess says Hi <@526853083993735173>, please DM me for office hours/support
0xJess says getAssetPrice(address asset) will return the price of the asset depending on the market e.g. USD, or ETH
donoso_eth says Hi  <@1004323901783945268> , can i query the current APY from an asset within the pool, I don't find the corresponding function?
donoso_eth says I  am  doing calls from a contract, not using subgraphs
donoso_eth says <@1004323901783945268> is the function scaledTotalSupply used to calculate the APY in the atoken contract?
0xJess says Hello! This documentation shows on-chain for v2: https://docs.aave.com/developers/v/2.0/guides/apy-and-apr#on-chain (use Pool.sol if using V3)
0xJess says The scaled total supply is the sum of all the updated stored balances, divided by the reserve index at the moment of the update
0xJess says <@923971611047112705> Some extra info: https://docs.aave.com/risk/liquidity-risk/borrow-interest-rate#interest-rate-model. And a really cool new dev tool from Newt (https://twitter.com/wearenewt/status/1565010368077991937) --- https://www.config.fyi/ which helps to see risk parameters more clearly
0xJess says Hey! You can DM me if you'd like to talk
l0gykal says Hey, do someone knows how to get the aToken address when you have the Token address?
defispartan says The ProtocolDataProvider (V2) or PoolDataProvider (V3) has a function called getReserveTokenAddresses which returns the aToken and debtToken addresses for an asset
l0gykal says Thxü§ü
hashharan says Hey all, I'm working on optimism aave market. I have a scenario where I want to withdraw the entire usdc collateral in the user's account from inside solidity. When I do getUserAccountData what is the currency of the totalCollateralBase variable. How to do I convert it to USDC in order to call the withdraw amount with it.
I tried getting the rate from oracle but the rate I got from the oracle for usdc did not make a lot of sense to me

The **Aave Protocol** is one of the most widely used decentralized liquidity protocols that allows users to supply and borrow digital assets. With demand for a stablecoin in the Aave ecosystem, the Aave Companies introduced GHO. **GHO** is a decentralized, over-collateralized, asset-backed stablecoin that is native to the Aave Protocol and pegged to the U.S. dollar.
