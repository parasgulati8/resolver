platocrat says Question/Recommendation:  added NXM (probably by adding the contract address) to 1inch but then realized that NXM (the *unwrapped* version) only has liquidity on NexusMutual's native dapp. I think it would be great, even for tokens similar to NXM, **to have a caution/warning modal that notifies the user that they will find NO liquidity**, or **restrict trading on such tokens**.
 Having either of these on the UI side would help users with less knowledge about tokens they're holding
platocrat says (<@!594174776679858196> <@!337604738763849741> can also put this into a GitHub issue, if that's easier)

sunnyrk says Hello, is there a 1inch subgraph on the thegraph
sunnyrk says ?
juwu says https://thegraph.com/explorer/subgraph/1inch-exchange/one-inch-v2
sunnyrk says <@!510348889379831812> thank you üôÇ
juwu says Hey 1inch team! <@!736709108757168211> and I are wondering if it's possible to get the creation time of a token from 1inch's subgraph. Not seeing it in the `Token` query
sunnyrk says Hi 1inch team,
I was not able to see the data for daily timestamp how much liquidity were in the pool pair on your subgraph... 
I am follwing this subgraph `https://thegraph.com/explorer/subgraph/1inch-exchange/one-inch-v2`
i want to calculate ROI and asset change in different time span for past...
Marco says hey, I'm looking at the leverage on AAVE with flashloan and 1inch swap bounty, I have a doubt

by "2. Convert it to ETH using 1inch API" I guess you mean to exec the trade through swap() in 1inch.exchange v2 contract deployed at 0x111111125434b319222CdBf8C261674aDB56F3ae right?  is there any documentation for the v2 contracts like the one for v1?
emilyhobbs says cc <@!430518305669775401> üëÄ
artspark says Hi there, I'm thinking of a system where users have a certain amount deposited with AAVE, and then can switch which token they have deposited on the fly using 1Inch. My questions are 1) This is just as simple as using 1inch to swap from one interest bearing token to another, right? 2) Are there any slippage or other risks in swapping I should disclose to my users, and how might I quantify that for them? 3) The main purpose of this is so that users can swap to the token producing the most yield at any time, but is there some kind of token one can hold that will automatically do this for them?
jamestheory says Hi I was wondering if in the 1inch subgraph, `tradeVolume` and `tradeCount` are based on a rolling 24 hour window or something along those lines?
juwu says and to follow up on this, the results from a query like the one below are a bit odd. For ETH, it shows 5 for `tradeCount` and 0.44 for `tradeVolume`
```
{
  tokens(first:10) {
    id
    symbol
    name
    tradeVolume
    tradeCount
  }
}
```

Kirill | 1inch says 3. I don't know such tokens 2. you can fetch usd prices, for example, from coingecko, and look at src and dest token usd amounts 1. yes, it's simple swap
Kirill | 1inch says https://docs.1inch.exchange/api/
Kirill | 1inch says you can query like: timestamp_gt and timestamp_lt (or using block numbers)
Marco says hey <@!490960786668257303> I've checked that thanks, so do you mean that to integrate 1inch exchange v2 inside my smart contract I need to first use the api to get the transaction data and then pass that data to my contract which will exec the transaction?

if that's the case, how can I integrate that with a flashloan considering that when calling the api I will always get an error for not enough allowance/balance?
lherskind says Following along here, have a similar issue. To just test I have tried doing a swap from eth, and that works just fine if you provide the calldata from the api to the contract (see below)   
```
function swapEth(bytes calldata oneinchdata) public payable {
    address inch = address(0x111111125434b319222CdBf8C261674aDB56F3ae);
    (bool success, ) = inch.call{value: msg.value}(oneinchdata);
    require(success, "1inch call failed");
}
```
artspark says Thank you!
arkeo01 says Hello 1INCH Team!
I am Aniket, participating in MarketMake. I'd just graduated from Indian Institute of Technology Jodhpur and I am on a journey to master web3 dev. I am very inspired by your journey as to how a project can go from ETH New York to being a real-world product with such a high trading volume.
I found the 1Inch bounties for Market make to be interesting. Particularly the liquidation bot bounty. I feel this bot would have great utility to a regular user of defi and would also help me master working with multiple protocols at once.
I am not an experienced web3 dev, and would rate myself as 6 out of 10. Hence, I would really appreciate your help as to how should I go about developing this bot? What resources would you suggest I look into at the start? Let me know if I can DM someone in order to get guidance related to this...
Kirill | 1inch says yes, you can. You need to set fromAddress to your contract address and set disableEstimate=true
Kirill | 1inch says https://docs.1inch.exchange/api/
great_filter says Hi 1inch team. Our team is looking at #2. AAVE liquidation protection bot. What's the value add of this over Aavetomation?  https://medium.com/defi-saver/aavetomation-is-now-live-with-automatic-liquidation-protection-and-leveraging-available-c5c293f3f16e
Kirill | 1inch says I think this project doing protection against liquidating your possition
Kirill | 1inch says But 1inch allows you liquidate positions
great_filter says Implementing on 1inch seems very much possible, but aavetomation has very similar functionality. Not really clear what the difference would be.
t_snark says Hi folks, where are the docs for the v2 smart contracts? I don't mean the API but the actual contract for on-chain integration.
Kirill | 1inch says It's impossible to integrate onchain contract with interfaces. You need to fetch calldata from API and make a low lvl solidity call with this calldata
t_snark says Gotcha. That doesn't work with my use case. Is v1 going to stick around?
Kirill | 1inch says No, only latest v2
juwu says Hi! in the 1inch subgraph, are the `tradeVolume` and `tradeCount` based on the last 24 hours? https://thegraph.com/explorer/subgraph/1inch-exchange/one-inch-v2

jawe.eth says You can use fork mainnet with specific block number for tests and develop (example, howto - https://medium.com/@samajammin/how-to-interact-with-ethereums-mainnet-in-a-development-environment-with-ganache-3d8649df0876)

great_filter says We're trying to do a 1inch swap inside a flash loan. The API errors on our swap requests because the fromToken isn't available until after the flash loan begins. Is there a way to disable the API checks or do you have any suggestions? (we could try to get calldata before the flash loan, but can't because of the API checks the amount.)
Marco says disableEstimate=true
juwu says Hi 1inch team! question about this API endpoint: https://api.1inch.exchange/v2.0/swagger/#/Quote%2FSwap/getQuote
what exactly is the data returned in the `protocols` field? 
try a query like this one, for example: https://api.1inch.exchange/v2.0/quote?fromTokenAddress=0xeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee&toTokenAddress=0xa0b86991c6218b36c1d19d4a2e9eb0ce3606eb48&amount=199

0xgaby says Hi <@!490960786668257303> , our team is working on a vesting platform. We would like to ask for your feedback on a standard implementation of a Vesting contract. Kartik shared with me that you did your token distribution recently and may help us
belac says Can you share a link to the code?
.skywinder says send us a link to your project, or tell your idea
cyrillicw says Can anybody show example of calling 1inch swap from Solidity?
.skywinder says Hi, Julia. Will come back to you. 
<@!490960786668257303> <@!324456391186186242>
.skywinder says there is some nice examples available on our past Gitcoin hackhaton:
https://gitcoin.co/hackathon/gr8/?org=1inch-exchange
belac says as described in the docs, the protocols is the route of the trade https://docs.1inch.exchange/api/quote-swap
juwu says <@!430518305669775401> <@!243162625007943681> thank you! I found what I needed in the docs
cyrillicw says But they use 1inch v1, should we use 1inch v2?
0xgaby says Hi <@!243162625007943681> <@!430518305669775401> here is our project repo: https://github.com/1Hive/Vested/pull/22
0xgaby says And a discussion for the contract implementation: https://github.com/1Hive/Vested/discussions/19
0xgaby says For context, our idea: 
"Vested allows Promoters to distribute vested tokens via airdrops and/or discounted exchange. Promoters can deposit tokens, set up eligibility criteria, and offer distribution terms. Eligible users can perform actions to claim vested tokens and withdraw them over time."
cyrillicw says Can I use 1inch with my own tokens if they are not deployed in Main Net but in my fork?
zkkirol says Hey guys, I'm looking for smart contracts addresses on mainnet used by 1INCH. I cannot find it on website and github. Could someone please let me know where can I find verified addresses ? thanks !
gge says is 1INCH available on Kovan? I'd like to try testing some stuff related to aave and 1inch on a testnet
ducklover22 says No. However, I found that forking mainnet using hardhat or ganache was WILDLY easier than messing with testnet. If you feel like it, it might be worth a try.
zkkirol says could someone please verify the address ?
ducklover22 says Any ideas why the 1proto.eth contract gives me an expected return of 0 when I try to swap aUSDC to DAI?
belac says You're most likely using the new aUSDC, which isn't supported as AAVE v2 hasn't been implemented into 1proto.eth yet
belac says Hello, what addresses do you need?

We have the exchange (which needs the API to be used https://docs.1inch.exchange/api/)
0x111111125434b319222CdBf8C261674aDB56F3ae

on chain aggregation at https://etherscan.io/address/1proto.eth
And
https://etherscan.io/address/1split.eth
(along with their github here https://github.com/1inch-exchange/1inchProtocol)
xbalbinus says Hi 1Inch team! I wanted to know how to integrate with your Swap feature. How might I do that?
belac says on the 1inch.exchange v2 router correct? or are you looking at 1proto.eth or 1split.eth?
xbalbinus says Yep! the v2 router
belac says I'm going to have to tag <@!490960786668257303> 

But if I had to guess (since I haven't ever worked with this).
 
A) you need to use web3.js or web3.py
A') don't forget to approve the tokens
B) You MUST use the API to get specific data to pass to the 1inch router contract
C) you must build a transaction for web3 passing the parameters value, from, and data to the 1inch router. this transaction built with web3

Here is the api: https://docs.1inch.exchange/api/quote-swap
router: https://etherscan.io/address/0x111111125434b319222CdBf8C261674aDB56F3ae#writeProxyContract
k8989 says Let's say I take a flashloan of 1 Eth from Aave, exploit some arbitrage opportunity, and now I want to swap back to Eth to pay off the flash loan. Is there any method on 1inch  like swapTokensForExactTokens to get back exactly 1 Eth.
nyanloutre says Hello, when using Ganache how can I use the 1inch API to generate the transaction data ? As it is checking the balance of the from address, which will be zero as I work on a fork, it will return in error.
belac says disableEstimate=true 

according to comments above. I'm not exactly sure how it works.
belac says There is not. you'll have to make sure the estimated return amount - slippage % is > 1 ETH 
(Since aggregating in reverse is difficult for non-AMM liquidity sources)
nyanloutre says OK I will try this
xbalbinus says <@!243162625007943681> Would you mind letting me know how to incorporate the API into my blockchain project? I'm a very new coder
belac says I don't code blockchain/web3. I'm not sure how to.
xbalbinus says All good, thanks a ton still for the help!
k8989 says My project involves leveraging on Aave using 1inch. Aave is available on the testnet but 1inch isn't. Is my only choice to submit on the mainnet? It won't be a smooth experience as anyone trying out the project will be hesitant to send actual tokens to an unaudited contract and will also need to pay gas fees. Can I rather deploy my contracts using a hosted hardhat node (mainnet forked) in my final submission? Anyone can then access my web app by simply connecting their metamask wallet to my hosted hardhat network config and smoothly test out all the utilities.
.skywinder says hi. you are right. 
 we don't have testnet. but it would be a great hack option for open track bounty! üëç
gge says does 1split.eth still worth? I heard it was deprecated
k8989 says Isn't there a separate prize for leveraging on Aave using 1inch swap? It's there in the prizes section of marketmake info center.
belac says 1split.eth and 1proto.eth should still work
nyanloutre says Hello, is there any way to do something like uniswap function swapTokensForExactTokens ?
I would like to be sure of how much a specific token I will get.
nyanloutre says Else I have to take slippage into account which add complexity
belac says There is no way to do that since non-AMM's don't have a function to do this, making the calculations more comples.
nyanloutre says OK, thank you !
nyanloutre says I have 500 errors with the API, is there something going on ?
belac says Yes, something with cloud flare/ our servers. hang tight while we fix the problem
nyanloutre says OK, good luck with the fix
jamestheory says Hey <@!337604738763849741> <@!430518305669775401> thanks for your support. We ended up using the 1inch subgraph and 1inch APIs for our project Poolside (https://poolside.finance)
ducklover22 says And a thanks to <@243162625007943681> for the help during the hackathon too! My team used 1Inch's 1proto.eth contract to do a swap in our project, The Watchful Eye. Hope some of you are there for judging tomorrow!

reddyismav says Hey 1inch guys, 
This is team LevAave. We were one of the finalists.
We applied for the 1inch bounty where we had to open long and short positions using flash loans.
We can OPEN both long and short positions and also CLOSE them. We are just a little surprised on not winning the bounty.

Mantis can just open a long position. No Shorting or closing positions. 
On the UI side too,  we feel we were quite better. 
On the gas price too, we were somewhere around 950k. Mantis has a gas price of 1.6 million. 

Just a little surprised, and we were wondering if you guys missed checking out our project.

emilyhobbs says Hey everyone! üëã 

Just wanted to drop a quick intro & overview for 1inch!

üëÄ **About**
**The 1inch Network** unites decentralized protocols whose synergy enables the most lucrative, fastest and protected operations in the DeFi space.

The initial protocol of the 1inch Network is a DEX aggregator solution that searches deals across multiple liquidity sources, offering users better rates than any individual exchange. This protocol incorporates the Pathfinder algorithm which finds the best paths among different markets over more than 49 liquidity sources on Ethereum and 12 liquidity sources on Binance Smart Chain. In less than two years the 1inch DEX aggregator surpassed $30B in overall volume.

The 1inch Aggregation Protocol facilitates cost-efficient and secure swap transactions across multiple liquidity sources.

The 1inch Liquidity Protocol is a next-generation automated market maker that protects users from front-running attacks and offers attractive opportunities to liquidity providers.

üèÜ **Prize Overview**
**1inch Network will award 5,000 USD in 1INCH:**

**Mesh network using Web RTC for exchange of limit orders of different protocols**

- ***First place:*** 2,500 USD in 1INCH
- ***Runner-up:*** 1,500 USD in 1INCH

**Open track**

- ***One prize for the most innovative project:*** 1,000 USD in 1INCH

belac says https://ethereumprice.org/gas/ maybe not the best time yet üòÖ since it's been cheaper recently
coinselector says üëã  Question for the first challenge:  "Margin trading on the 1inch Limit Order Protocol", are there any specific requirements for the margin trading functionality? Do we need to consider liquidation logic or should we focus on order creation with initial margin position?
sarvesh3262 says Hey 1Inch Team, 
Question:  I see there are 1inch APIs to get quote and swap transaction data but is there any documentation to estimate best returns and gas via smart contract call/view function?

I tried swap API the response doesn't match the  values shown on https://1inch.exchange/

I see this repo is marked as deprecated 
https://github.com/1inch/1inchProtocol
dearnadia says You can build the strategy you want. You can create only liquidation positions or create orders to open and close positions 

The second one is more interesting <:stickers_004:758981992401993769>
dearnadia says You can use /swap endpoint with disableEstimate=false flag. You need to have sufficient balance of fromTokenAddress and approve to 1inchV3 contract. And you will be able to get estimated gas in response
sarvesh3262 says is it possible to get the same info using smart contract view function?
sarvesh3262 says <@!418840881358176257>  Getting internal server error on swap API.  Shared details in DM
0xgidone says Hi 1Inch Team!
Is it possible to set your Stop Loss orders on-chain (and not only on the front-end side?)
dearnadia says <@!842000341791801376> you don't need to use our frontend for hack

and also, it's impossible to get quote from smart contract
oxmarco says I think by using Chainlink API scraper one could invoke 1Inch API from a smart contract, although having a direct on chain interface would be much more helpful
dearnadia says You can see an example for stop loss with limit orders here:
https://github.com/1inch/limit-order-protocol/blob/master/test/ChainLinkExample.js

solarpunksurfer says Hi skywinder,

I hope you doing great, 

I was wondering, 1inch will be interested that my team builds a  PnL trade analyzer for 1inch with Graph (API)?  By itself could be extremely useful for users. Indeed, most of the crypto wallets do not have it.  Thus, is a great feature after for ages we managing our PnL in a spreadsheet in excel.

Looking forward to seeing your second thoughts.

May the force be with you,

Joshua Eick
dearnadia says Hi <@!725825203896189040> ! Maybe you have a demo or presentation?
solarpunksurfer says PnL Tracker -1inch¬†

Story
Since 2017 actively using multiple wallets to be able to invest in different cryptocurrencies like:¬†
¬†
-Abra-invest and earn an APY in your crypto deposits
-Coinbase wallet-earn interest
-Atomic wallet-staking
-Infinito wallet-deposits
-jaxx wallet- deposits

-1inch- start using it -how much you save from using the exchange aggregator 
¬†
Problem
To be able to track my PnL you have to do it manually in Excel. It‚Äôs completely a hassle and extremely a paint point. Indeed,¬†It's critical to understanding your transaction cost, yield farming, and add transparency.
¬†
¬†
Solution
Build the product through subgraph form graph sponsored is complete more seamlessness.
Emulate the dashboard of Bloomberg PnL which is the best investments platform and add extra features and indicators.
¬†
For instance:
If you already have a smart contract deployed in 1inch, bootstrapping a new subgraph from this contract can be a good way to get started.
The following command creates a subgraph that indexes all events of an existing contract.
¬†
Top Tree features of the PnL tracker:
1-Transaction costs
2-Incorporate yield farming¬†
3-Easily to import and copied for your tax returns.
¬†¬†
Unique Value Proposition
Transparency and a crystal clear understanding of your PnL in crypto investments.
¬†
¬†¬†
Call to action:
Let me know second thoughts, 1inch team.

Looking forward to building the cutting-edge PnL tracker in the blockchain technology space.
¬†
May the force be with you,
¬†

filipevenancio.eth says Where can I read how the virtualized pools work?
sarfang says hey can we get the rinkbey addresses for the 1inch token contract, the GovernanceMothership contract, and GovernanceRewards contract?
belac says I don't believe they exist
belac says https://mooniswap.exchange/docs/MooniswapWhitePaper-v1.0.pdf
here, though mooniswap is deprecated it lives on in the 1inch liquidity protocol
tobowers says ahoy. does 1inch have a smart contract API?
tobowers says Here's what I want to do: zap from one token into two tokens (and then into an LP)
tobowers says I don't think the API supports two outputs
tobowers says fwiw would be super cool if 1inch offered zaps - makes total sense with the routing protocol
tobowers says "I want to deposit 100 matic into the sushi ibWBTC/WBTC LP pool... route me efficiently please"
belac says Sadly only legacy.1inch.exchange supports zaps and on ETH only, and the lp tokens have to be uniswap LP tokens. 
But in theory someone could build a zap feature with the 1inch swap API and integrating the pools
tobowers says yeah that's what I'm going to do for a specific pool for this hackathon, but it's a little tricky because the amounts needed of each token can change between calling your API
tobowers says that's why I was wondering about a smart contract API where could do the requests as part of a transaction
belac says there's no way to get a quote (or the swap data) on-chain directly üòï
Just the API for swaps
tobowers says yeah I guess you don't really want onchain quotes anyway
belac says there was this: https://github.com/1inch/1inchProtocol

but it is deprecated now and has some issues that will not ever be resolved.
tobowers says does the onchain swap API need to know the route or does it figure it out?
tobowers says are there docs for that somewhere?
belac says the swap api call on the 1inch v3 router needs the route. it can't figure it out itself
tobowers says ok - so then I think what I'm doing is probably the best solution...
tobowers says we have a smart contract wallet so I get the two quotes and figure out how much is needed for both destination tokens, but then I do the swap/swap/deposit all in a single transaction and if that fails I can re-quote
tobowers says and it's on polygon so I don't really care about gas üôÇ
tobowers says that would actually be a pretty cool and efficient generic zapper for anything with uniswap v2 interface
tobowers says another hackathon I guess lol
tobowers says oh hmm - i'm trying to do this: "mint, approve, swap" inside a single transaction, but the 1inch API doesn't return the swap because the account doesn't have enough balance (because the mint hasn't happened)
belac says disableEstimate=true will stop the balance check, but it will remove a gas price and gas limit to work with
tobowers says that's great - don't need those anyway since it's part of a multisend
se3jay says Hey 1inch team! Is there a subgraph available for 1inch? I'm looking to query historical information about liquidity pools. Or is this information maybe available somewhere else?
belac says endpoint https://thegraph.com/explorer/subgraph/1inch-exchange/oneinch-liquidity-protocol-v2
schema:
se3jay says Thanks!!!
phazejeff says hey 1inch, is there a way to use the `/swap` endpoint on a testnet?
belac says no
belac says but you can fork the mainnet and use the /swap endpoint with that
phazejeff says I'm not sure how I would do that, is there some guide on this?
belac says https://support.chainstack.com/hc/en-us/articles/900001783063-Forking-Ethereum-mainnet-with-Ganache-CLI
Try this
phazejeff says Thanks!
booleanring says what's the proper way of using the calldata from the `/swap` endpoint in solidity code? I've been trying the following, but it seems to fail so I assume the `msg.value` has to be some other value: ```
oneInchExchange.call{value: 0}(oneInchData)
```
where oneInchData is the `tx.data` from the `/swap` endpoint and `oneInchExchange` is the oneInch v3 address
belac says if you're in the 1inch discord, you can check out this https://discord.com/channels/730042542229422121/730308064917585920/855849975220535296

0xdars says Hey is 1inch fusion only offchain or are there contracts we can call onchain directly to route trades?
neeel.eth says gm! question, I've got 2 api calls where the only difference is the destination token (stETH & rETH) and the calldata the API is giving me back has a different structure. Both have a straight (direct) route ETH -> stETH & ETH -> rETH.

stETH: https://api.1inch.io/v5.2/1/swap?amount=1000000&src=0xEeeeeEeeeEeEeeEeEeEeeEEEeeeeEeeeeeeeEEeE&dst=0xae7ab96520de3a18e5e111b5eaab095312d7fe84&from=0x24509E1F87eDD8fC7c00f0738f45bC70aCe8BD4B&slippage=0.5&disableEstimate=true&receiver=0x62450f4067C79EfdBF2ABd5ae6F089d81cd6672d

rETH: https://api.1inch.io/v5.2/1/swap?amount=1000000&src=0xEeeeeEeeeEeEeeEeEeEeeEEEeeeeEeeeeeeeEEeE&dst=0x6b175474e89094c44da98b954eedeac495271d0f&from=0x24509E1F87eDD8fC7c00f0738f45bC70aCe8BD4B&slippage=0.5&disableEstimate=true&receiver=0x62450f4067C79EfdBF2ABd5ae6F089d81cd6672d

I'm decoding the calldata before calling the swap on your router contract to know how much to transfer (SwapDescription.amount)

`(,IPool.SwapDescription memory desc) = abi.decode(swapData[i][4:], (address, IPool.SwapDescription));`
swapData[0] = stETH -> succeeds decoding
swapData[1] = rETH -> fails decoding

The rETH one is much shorter. I've tried ETH->DAI and it's also very short. Not sure why it has different structure. Do you know?
neeel.eth says stETH:

rETH:

The size different is quite noticable but both are the exact same request except for destination token
belac says üëã  sorry for the delay in response. 
if you'll notice the rETH function selector is different 0xf78dc253
if you want to **force** the function selector 0x12aa3caf then you'll need to use compatibility mode = true. I think it might just be `compatibility` now with v5.2 API though
belac says 
belac says the function in the rETH swap is `unoswapTo` which means there is a specific destination address *and* the only liquidity pools in use is uniswap v2 like pools
belac says 1inch fusion doesn't have the user do any routing, it's the resolvers that do the routing. Likely it's off-chain but it could be on-chain, like if they referenced a uniswap quoter or something üòÑ 

the fusion contracts just allow-list certain resolvers contracts, or workers
neeel.eth says You saved my life right there, compatibility made it ‚ù§Ô∏è
belac says amazing!
neeel.eth says Are you at the venue?
belac says I'm not there myself :(
belac says I believe <@438140396153995268> is
neeel.eth says Sooo now I got consistant calldata buuuuut my second swap is failing and I'm not sure why...

```
    function executeSwaps(address _pool, bytes[] calldata swapData) external payable nonReentrant {
      IPoolFactory factory = IPoolFactory(controller.getPoolFactory());
      
      if (!factory.isPool(_pool)) {
        revert InvalidPool();
      }

      uint256[] memory amounts = new uint256[](swapData.length);
      for(uint i = 0; i < swapData.length; i++) {
        (,IPool.SwapDescription memory desc) = abi.decode(swapData[i][4:], (address, IPool.SwapDescription));
        (bool success, bytes memory returnData) = controller.getOneInch().call{value: desc.amount}(swapData[i]);

        if (!success) {
          revert DexSwapFailed();
        }
        (uint256 returnAmount,) = abi.decode(returnData, (uint256,uint256));
        amounts[i] = returnAmount;
      }

      IPool(_pool).deposit(amounts);
    }
```
it's throwing `DexSwapFailed`
`swapData` it's made of 2 calldatas one for stETH which works, but the second one with rETH it's failing now, not sure what's different... any clues?
neeel.eth says Another thing is I'm getting "insufficient liquidity" when trying to SWAP ETH to DAI or USDC üëÄ 

```https://api.1inch.io/v5.2/1/swap?amount=10000&src=0xEeeeeEeeeEeEeeEeEeEeeEEEeeeeEeeeeeeeEEeE&dst=0xa0b86991c6218b36c1d19d4a2e9eb0ce3606eb48&from=0x24509E1F87eDD8fC7c00f0738f45bC70aCe8BD4B&slippage=5&disableEstimate=true&receiver=0x62450f4067C79EfdBF2ABd5ae6F089d81cd6672d&compatibility=true````
belac says 10000 wei of ETH -> USDC, that's 0.00000000000001 ETH -> USDC üòÑ
belac says unfortunately not exactly sure on this <:monkaHmm:663779021892354098> 
unless you forked the network and slippage has occured.
neeel.eth says Oooh so it‚Äôs too low ok
neeel.eth says I set slippage to 50%. I‚Äôm using a fork of mainnet
neeel.eth says I‚Äôve also been told to set partial fullfills to false
neeel.eth says But still failing
neeel.eth says Sometimes it succeeds though (same code)
neeel.eth says https://dashboard.tenderly.co/shared/fork/simulation/947d0563-fb4f-4273-81c1-c9ad6f099505
neeel.eth says That‚Äôs a failed case
neeel.eth says https://dashboard.tenderly.co/shared/fork/simulation/c00c6af3-fd7a-43df-a0a4-a8b26c071c33
neeel.eth says That‚Äôs a success case
belac says https://dashboard.tenderly.co/shared/fork/simulation/947d0563-fb4f-4273-81c1-c9ad6f099505/debugger?trace=0.4.3.1.0.0.1.1
no idea why success wasn't `true` here as the balance adjustments were all correct <:monkaHmm:663779021892354098>
neeel.eth says I May just use Uniswap as backup if success false, fake it til you mark it approach üòÇ
neeel.eth says I tried, hard üòî
crocovivant says Hey I've got a question
crocovivant says did you guys have seen any project combining Near and 1inch ?
crocovivant says Is it possible to use 1inch on a front-end application deployed on Near BOS ?
tradersnow1inch says See comment below ‚¨áÔ∏è
roundelephant says This is actually possible (just like Lido‚Äôs front end is deployed on Near BOS)
crocovivant says thanks
roundelephant says Only reason I know this is because I met a NEAR Dev the other night and he showed me on his phone how this can be done. And I asked him this specific question after he showed me the Lido example. 

1inch front end is not open source so whatever you build would have to be from scratch.
crocovivant says thank you for your answer. Definitly good to know. Will try it now. ty
