sey323 says Hello. What kind of blockchain does this API support?
I would like to experiment with a testnet.
ipeciura.eth says Hi <@806453232028876811> we currently support Ethereum and Polygon mainnet. No testnets. 

We encourage you to poke around https://app.airstack.xyz/ for inspiration. If you decide to build on Polygon we can send you some Matic to play around.
sey323 says I see. 
I have already confirmed that as well. Additional question, is it possible to search NFTs created in Layer2?
ipeciura.eth says On Polygon - yes.
sey323 says Ok. Thanx

.sinane says Hi, can we get data from testnet with airstack ?
ipeciura.eth says Hi Sean, it seems we connected on Telegram. Pasting the same just in case:
at the moment we only have Etehruem and Polygon mainnets. If you're planning to hack - we can send you some Matic to get you started on Polygon.
anson5805 says Hi <@960546692585910303> can i have some Matic as well? was trying to query from mumbai as well:
```0x33e143139d43bCD0ABa3D6a05de0A32d8392a375```
ipeciura.eth says I see you also got it from Telegram  🙂
xquietude says Is it possible and not too difficult to fetch all DAOs that an address is eligible to participate in ? And fetch possible delegates of it
ipeciura.eth says Not sure I follow the question - can you share an example?
ipeciura.eth says We currently don't have DAO-specific information, such as delegates.

However, you can fetch all DAO token holders by entering the contract address.

tomi2253 says Hi is there a way to find the DAOs an address belongs to?
sarvesh3262 says Hi,
If DAO has any token(NFT or erc20), which represent membership. You can check token holding of wallet.  

For example if a wallet holds Nouns DAO or Orange DAO nft, It can be used to check DAO membership

paliiiine says Hi, trying to do the query but you guys don't support POlygon Mumbai?
salief says Yeah, they just support Ethereum Mainnet and Polygon Mainnet
paliiiine says Cool I have my query on POlygon, it's all good, i tried it out on the studio. But  I just want to fetch and render it in my Front end. Do I have to use a hook or is a simple fetch possible? I have a very simple query on a onClick. The examples are more complex than what I need really
yosephks says Hey <@834426455123034145> yeah at the moment we don't, but if you need to test some things out on mainnet, we can provide you w/ some mainnet MATIC 🙏 

Just DM me I'll provide you some
yosephks says fetch doesn't work as fetch is only for REST API and ours is using GraphQL

You don't necessarily need the hook that is offered by our SDK, but it does make it simpler

Feel free to use any other GraphQL library that you prefer to call Airstack

Also let me know what data are you fetching in particular, I can assist w/ getting the data you need for your app 🙏
